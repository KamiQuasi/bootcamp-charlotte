January 2014 Charlotte Startup Weekend Bootcamp
=================================================

Calling Charlotte's developers. If you've been wanting to find out about the buzz surrounding Single Page Apps, come to the AngularJS Bootcamp hosted by Charlotte Startup Weekend and sponsored by Google.

Learn about the basics for building a Single Page Application using Google's Angular Javascript framework. We will cover how to get up and running quickly as well as dive deeper into some more advanced topics, like directives, animation, and look at packaging apps for mobile and desktop. There will also be opportunities to do some coding so bring a laptop for full effect.

Luke Dary from the Research Triangle Google Developer's Group will be leading the day's activities so come out to Packard Place on January 18th and attend this awesome day-long workshop.

We know that during a Startup Weekend event there isn't a lot of time to learn new things. You come in with the tools you have in your belt, and you do the best you can with those. But sometimes those tools aren't enough, which is why we're running this pre-Startup Weekend technical bootcamp:
